# Multiple inheritance ==>> remaining for feb 29
''' 
Other language doesnot apply multiple inheritance because
They create ambiguity 
like parent 1 has a buy function and parent 2 has also
buy method 
and  we make child class object to call the buy method
like c = child()
c.buy()
here buy is in both class 
so , it create ambiguity in other languaage 


but python supports the multiple inheritance  



====================================

in multiple inheritance there is 
# two or more Parent class and one parent
