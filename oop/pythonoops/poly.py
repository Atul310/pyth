# There is no such thing like method overloading 

# There is already a feature for method overloading 
#for 29 feb 2023


      
# Operator overloading 
# Multiple form of operators such as
print(1+2) # output is 3
print([1,2,3]+[4,5,6]) # output is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print("hello " + "world") # output  is hello world
''' 
Here above is the operator overloading 
where same (+) plus opertor works differently
on different form such as 
first give ==>> addition of  numbers
2nd give ==>> merging of list 
3rd give ==>> concatenation of string
